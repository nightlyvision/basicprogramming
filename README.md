Points to note
The following simple program to calculate the area of a circle
two variables used namely:
			radius
			area
NB:// area has to be a double format instead of an interger since the formula to calculate area of a circle will have decimals after using Ï€ which is equals to 3.141592.
flow:
initialize the interger value radius, accept input of radius using printf and scanf.
store the area in variable (double) then output area.
